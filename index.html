          <h1>Jake Watson</h1>
          <p>
              I've been building startup go-to-market teams for 10 years and recently took a break to pursue a Master's in Computer Science, with a focus on Machine Learning. I'm a lifelong student of communication, and my current interests are in applying analytics engineering and reinforcement learning to improve decision-making.
